# AI-ENABLED-WATER-WELL-PREDICTOR
# 🌊 AI-Enabled Ground Water Well Prediction System

A comprehensive web-based application built using Streamlit and machine learning to predict groundwater availability, recommend suitable well depth, and suggest drilling techniques based on NAQUIM datasets. The platform is designed to support sustainable water resource management through data-driven insights and intuitive visualizations.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Groundwater Prediction**: Uses Random Forest Regressor to estimate extractable groundwater resource.
- 🕳️ **Well Depth Suggestion**: Recommends suitable well depth based on current extraction.
- 🛠️ **Drilling Method Guidance**: Suggests appropriate drilling technique (e.g., rotary, percussion).
- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**: Visualizes water quality and quantity using location data.
- 📈 **Graphs & Analytics**: District/state-wise insights for irrigation and domestic water usage.
- 📄 **PDF Report Generator**: Auto-generates downloadable groundwater reports.
- 📝 **Feedback Module**: Collects user feedback for continuous improvement.
- 🔒 **Secure & Offline Ready**: Can be run locally for offline access.
